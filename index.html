    <h1> The Race War, and Why It Isn't Really a War

      <h2> Bio </h2>
      <p>
        Before I go in depth to race relations in America, I just want to share a little bit about me to both establish my credibility and to share my side of the story. I'm a seemingly carefree black girl that loves to talk about race, but I wasn't always this way, in fact, I haven't even been this way for 2 whole years. The reality of my blackness has been shaped by the events in the news and even those events that never made it to public eye. I attend a PWI, studying Communication and Marketing, and its awakened something inside of me. So now, I'm just a young black woman talking about what's going on in the world from what I can tell and capturing the lives and stories of others while I do it. I am not anti white, just pro black and concerned with educating others while I learn more myself since it seems no one else wants to do it. So in the words of Gil Scott-Heron,"the revolution will not be televised."

      <h3> What is a War? </h3>
      <p>
        A war, according to Merriam Webster, is (1) a state of usually open and declared armed hostile conflict between states or nations (2) :  a period of such armed conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        A war incites that there is an agreed upon disagreement that both sides is trying to change in their favor. A war is not an attack on the innocent, it is not armed conflict against unarmed confllict. In Amerikkka the war has not changed and it still is not a real war. Both sides are not against one another and there is not an equal chance for victory. One side, the side actually fighting, is outmanning, out gunning and overpowering the innocent side, just trying to survive. It is this struggle to survive that really shows the difference between being white and being black, or any PoC.

      <h4> A Life in the Times of People of Color </h4>
      <p>
        "Its a hard knock life, for us." No really, it is a hard knock life for us. Now this is in no way a cry about how hard it is to be black or a PoC but it IS a call to action to fix or at least recognize the inequalities faced. Money rules the world, regardless of what people think, and money or financial inequalities are huge. One major one is with employment obstacles that black people face. African American men with a college degree have the <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/a-black-college-student-has-the-same-chances-of-getting-a-job-as-a-white-high-school-dropout-b7639607fdf1#.valnmsxfy"> same likeliness to be employed </a> as a White male who dropped out of high school. So that's more debt for the African American man, and less job opportunities to pay off that debt and integrate into society. In addition to the struggle of unemployment with a degree, African Americans face discrimination with the <a href="http://jezebel.com/5822293/man-takes-fake-white-name-to-test-job-discrimination"> resume test </a>. Black or ethnic sounding names typically are overlooked or disregarded for white sounding names. Multiple studies have been done on this and it shows that while a white name only needs to submit 6 resumes to get a job or call back, a black name on a resume requires <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/black-graduates-top-colleges-face-discrimination-job-search-salaries-study-finds-1847590"> 8. </a> To add on to the difficulties of being employed while black, there is the reoccuring issue with the appearances of Black people, specifically with their hair. Natural hair, including dreadlocks, are considering untidy, unkept, and unprofessional in the work place, proving as a discrimination towards the very natural look of black people. There is a constant worry that many black people share that when they go in for a job opportunity, they will be rejected for being too black. Or they will be hired for being just black enough and filling the token role. Black people have to <a href="http://nhi.org/online/issues/147/privilegedplaces.html"> go above and beyond </a> just to be in the same playing field as their white counterparts.
      </p>
      <p> Another issue is with the labeling of black people. There are so many negative stereotypes and labels of black people that I will only name a few. These labels are everywhere, seen so frequently people probably do not notice them or think of them as stereotypes, but rather as some universal truth of the world.

      <h5> Attacks on a Culture: Cultural Appropriation </h5>
      <p>
        There's a difference between loving a culture and appreciating it, and fetishizing a culture and hating those who created it. Appreciating a culture, and certain aspects of it, involves a knowledge of the <a href="http://racerelations.about.com/od/diversitymatters/fl/What-Is-Cultural-Appropriation-and-Why-Is-It-Wrong.htm"> history </a> behind the culture. They do not have to know in depth dates or ancient artifacts but they should know the struggle behind the culture and that picking up an item from a culture can cause problems. Let's take hair for example since it is commonly appropriated. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/allure-afro-appreciation-appropriation_us_55cbac23e4b064d5910a5ddd?utm_hp_ref=cultural-appropriation"> “The problem with appropriating cultures is that you take on the afro or the cornrow or the box braid without understanding the history behind it,” “And when you don’t understand the history behind something, you don’t understand the context in which it’s done, and that’s what makes it offensive.” </a> As I mentioned before, black people are commonly ostracized for their hair, especially in the workplace. So the issue is not just white people wearing black hairstyles (or some other privileged group taking something from a minority group) but that they do not face the same stuggles as a black person wearing a black hairstyle, yet they do receive all the credit. How often have you seen a white girl with <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-times-black-culture-was-appropriated-in-2015_us_566ee11de4b011b83a6bd660?utm_hp_ref=cultural-appropriation"> box braids, bantu knots, cornrows, or locs? </a> How often is she called "ghetto" "ratchet" or "dirty"? Yet how often do you hear those descriptions paired with those hairstyles on a black person? There lies the problem; black people have culturally significant things such as hairstyles stolen from them and then glorified on a white person. Just in case you were wondering, blackface (which is very much racist) and white washing, also go hand in hand with cultural appropriation.
