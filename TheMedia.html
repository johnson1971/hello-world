    <h1> The Media Representation </h1>
  <body>
    <p> There are issues with the media in many aspects. I study this and I can say I have noticed there flaws as both apart of the community and an outsider. Of the many issues with the media one of the biggest ones is with their linguistic representation of the races. Specifically how the media presents news events focused on or primarily about black people and how the presentation of this information reinforces negative stereotypes. </p>
    <p> One of the first specific media representations issues that needs to be addressed is their usage of “protest” and “riot” After the death of Freddie Gray there were several large gatherings (avoiding the use of either word for demonstrative purposes) of primarily black people that caught the media's attention for days. These gatherings were primarily peaceful and the violent gatherings represented just a fraction of what actually occurred in Baltimore. Despite this several news sources, Fox News in particular, painted a negative image of violent riots throughout the city of Baltimore. </p>
    <p> On Fox News’ website if one is to search “Baltimore protest” only 5 results show up for this major news event yet if that search was altered to “Baltimore riots” there are more than 80 results for this new search.  The word thug rarely ever stands alone in these news reports. Words such as “bad guys” “looting” “lawlessness” “wild” “animals” “criminals” and other are used as alternatives to describe these “thugs” that are rioting or protesting over serious issues of injustice, abuse, and racial oppression. White people that riot or protest are called <a href=" http://www.alternet.org/media/shockingly-racist-contrast-how-media-describe-black-protests-and-white-riots"> “young people” “fans” “some” “maybe” “a little.” </a> There is a noticeable difference between the media’s portrayal of these two races. White people are not considered to represent their entire race, and their violence is viewed as a result of other enthusiasm and is justified behavior for some young people. Black people represent their entire race in all of their negative actions and the media tries use these actions to try label and judge all black people as violent, savage, animals. <p>
    <p> Another similar instance of this issue is with the description of the Black Panthers and terrorist group KKK. The Black Panthers who typically were/are nonviolent have negative stigmas attached to their name as a rebellious group attempting to force their ideas on others by advocating the use of violence and guerilla tactics to overthrow the U.S. government. Gatherings of the Black Panthers are/were heavily regulated and monitored by a police presence whereas the KKK, a prominent Christian terrorist organization is usually seen as having peaceful protests protected by the police. <p>
    <p> This media issue of labeling one race as having protests and the other as having riots represents a larger social truth. The first being that white privilege is real along with its equal counterpart, black oppression. The second is that people in power, the media in this case, control people’s perceptions and have the power to continue linguistic oppression if they so desire. The coverage of the Baltimore gatherings further reinforces the stereotype of black people being angry and violent. Pathological stereotypes are ideas about groups of people that exist to explain and justify inequalities.<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/culturally-speaking/201112/african-americans-and-pathological-stereotypes"> These stereotypes lead to discrimination, racism, and reduced opportunities. </a> These stereotypes have contributed to the way that whites view blacks. <p>
    <p> The issue with the media showcasing black people is not always about what they say but they type of black people they present. Although the media alters and distorts almost everyone’s message that has ever been interviewed the way it is done towards blacks is unparalleled to that of any other racial or ethnic group. Traditionally the media might splice out a section of an interview or play different portions of a video out of order to present material in a way that it was not originally captured in order to sell a story, change a point of view or simply just try to make the news more entertaining. The term “infotainment” was created to describe the new genre of news that is combining entertainment or entertaining aspects with the news to better hold audience’s attention. Unfortunately a great deal of this entertainment is at the expense of black people. The black people chosen to be interviewed do not have to have their videos manipulated or interviews cut short, they are made fun of in a different way, a way that plays off of the stereotypes of all black people being poor and uneducated as seen through their speech patterns. Two of the best examples of this center around the interviews and 15 minutes of fame of both Antoine Dodson and Kimberly “Sweet Brown” Wilkins. <p>
    <p> The interview of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/15/antoine-dodson-internet-sensation"> Antoine Dodson </a> was intentionally done so to make blacks look drugged out, crazy, and uneducated. A bit of background on Dodson is that he gained his fame after stopping a rapist from raping his sister and the local news channel picked up the story shortly afterwards. Dodson spoke in a flamboyant manner that many called “ignorant”, “ghetto” and “ratchet” claiming that Dodson was “uneducated” and some audience members even questioned the integrity of the news source asking how they could interview “someone like him with a straight face.” Antoine Dodson was undoubtedly a hero in this instance but he was ridiculed for his way of talking, with songs and memes emerging about his very serious warning “to hide yo kids, hide yo wife and hide yo husband, because they're raping err'body out here." The media ignored his heroic actions and the prevalence of danger in his community and focused on presenting Dodson unedited, who would likely be seen as a representation of the entire black community, to make a mockery of him and his entire race. The issue is not with the event at hand, it is with how the event is covered and presented to audiences. This sort of subtle manipulation only contributes to the setbacks that black face on an everyday basis and those around them are force fed lies and stereotypes. <p>
    <p> Kimberly “Sweet Brown” Wilkins is the victim in the second example of the media using interviews to reinforce stereotypes. According to Wikipedia, the only website that has given any background on Wilkins since her initial incident of fame, Wilkins spoke to an NBC news affiliate about escaping a fire in early April on 2012 in Oklahoma. It; however, is not her escape with death that made her so memorable and granted her 15 minutes of fame. Much like Dodson, Wilkins came from a background that is stereotypical of all blacks and this was reflected in her manner of speaking. The phrase “ain’t nobody got time for that” was simply another thing to add to the list that black people have said that the media will frame as representing the lot of the race. Again, her interview was not traditionally manipulated but she herself was manipulated to fit into another stereotypical role in the black community. Even Wilkin’s style of dress could be linked to a stereotype, her physical appearance resembling that of a mammy. The media is well aware of what it is doing and yet nothing is being done to change it.</p>
    <p> The crowning and supreme stereotype that is being reinforced surrounds the difference between black women and white women. This is seen mainly around pop culture and celebrities but it is not only targeted to famous singers or actresses. The word feminist describes one who believes women should have equal rights as men whether that be getting the same jobs or receiving the same pay or just receiving the same pay, a feminist believes in women’s equality. The word feminist has been taken away from women such as Nicki Minaj, Amber Rose, or Beyonce claiming that they are too sexual and inappropriate to be feminist because of the skimpy leotards that they wear or the provocative dancing that they do. On the other hand, the media has been thrilled to call Miley Cyrus a feminist, even though she too wears “skimpy leotards” and tries her hand at twerking. Black women are demeaned, insulted and criticized for the same actions that white women are praised for. </p>
    <p> This also includes their physical features. Nicki Minaj’s body is gross and unnatural whereas Iggy Azalea of the same build is built like a goddess and sexy. Serena Williams is considered to manly and athletic but Caityln Jenner is beautiful and sexy. Black women are overly sexualized but the moment they come to accept this and their natural desires for sex they are labelled as a slut or whore. This is a stereotype that has been particular difficult for black women to overcome because even once these women accept that they are sexual beings the way the media portrays them they are labelled as only sexual in a negative way as if it is the defining feature of these women. Black women have not been allowed to be both of anything, they are either placed on one end of a spectrum or the other whereas white women can fluidly move around the spectrum and not be defined by one thing they do.</p>
    <p> Other instances of this revolve around Michelle Obama, Zendaya Coleman and North West, Kanye West’s daughter. Kim Kardashian is famous for one main thing in particular, something neither here nor there as far as her daughter is concerned. Recently Billboard’s twitter account posted a picture of Kim and North with her tongue out with the caption “The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree…” North, not even 3 years of age at the time, was sexualized. <a href="'Billboard' Apologizes for North West Tweet."> Billboard apologized </a> deleted the tweet and claimed that the caption was supposed to reference North’s dislike of paparazzi and how it was similar to that of her mother’s. This was not how the message was presented and even if it was, that is still insulting to North because she has on numerous occasions made it clear she does not want to be photographed. In this instance a biracial toddler was either sexualized or had her privacy snatched. There was no winning for Billboard in this instance.</p>
    <p> The second occasion involves Zendaya Coleman, another biracial individual, who recently wore her hair in a dreadlock style to an award show. The commenters, still a part of the media, <a href="http://www.people.com/article/zendaya-blasts-giuliana-rancic-oscars-dreadlocks-fashion-police"> made racist jokes </a> about Zendaya saying that her hair made her look as though she likely smelled like “patchouli oil or weed.” There are already plenty of stereotypes surround black people especially black women and their hair and for this comment to made with no remorse shows how little the media thinks about the effects of their words on black lives. To make matters worse, the same group of people praised Miley Cyrus’ hairstyle of fake dreadlocks and overall look during the VMAs calling her “a gift.” </p>
    <p> The concluding example involves Michelle Obama. Michelle Obama is a woman who is in the spotlight quite often and yet typically the media’s only focus on her is about her choice of outfit. She is a college educated woman who has done much for her country especially revolving around children’s nutrition and yet the media’s main concern with her is her appearance. The media takes away that black women can be educated and it is one of their worst fears as far as promoting that image. </p>
    <p> So why does any of this matter? Does any of this matter? It does and here is why, every statement that the media makes is taken in by thousands of people at the very least, people that trust the media and sometimes wholeheartedly believe what they have to say. If the media continues to hurt, slander, attack, and promote stereotypes of black people then in turn their audiences will continue to do so as well. It is mainly on the media but the audience can influence this change too. The media tends to give the audience what it wants; infotainment. It is the job of the audiences to stop accepting hurtful entertainment that is created at the expense of black people. They need to speak up and say that the content they are receiving is wrong. </p>
